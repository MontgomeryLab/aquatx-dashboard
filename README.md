# aquatx-dashboard
:warning: :construction: Under development :construction: :warning:

This repository contains the code being developed for the R shiny dashboard for running and configuring aquatx-srna in a simple, user-friendly manner. 

This tool is still very early stages and we are still playing around with all the things we can do with shiny and planning out how to wrap aquatx for users.

The readme will be updated with better information & instructions once this tool has a basic working version. Stay tuned! Thanks!
